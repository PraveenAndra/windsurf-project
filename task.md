# AI Resume Optimization Tool - Project Tasks

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an AI-powered resume optimization tool that tailors resumes to specific job descriptions. The system will analyze job descriptions to extract keywords, optimize resume content to highlight relevant skills and experience, ensure ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility, and seamlessly integrate with Overleaf LaTeX templates for professional formatting.

The tool will serve as both an ATS simulation system and a professional CV expert, making resumes sound strong, confident, and professional while ensuring they pass through automated application screening systems.

## Key Features

- **Job Description Analysis**: Extract keywords, skills, and requirements from job postings
- **Resume Content Optimization**: Tailor resume content to match job descriptions using AI
- **ATS Compatibility**: Ensure resume format and content are optimized for applicant tracking systems
- **LaTeX Template Integration**: Connect with Overleaf for professional LaTeX formatting
- **End-to-End Automation**: From job description input to optimized LaTeX resume output
- **Professional Enhancement**: Make resumes sound strong, confident, and professional
- **Keyword Matching**: Align resume content with job description keywords

## Technical Components

### 1. Core Resume Processing
